# Project History

## Session 1: Project Specification and Planning

### Completed Tasks
- Defined project specifications through conversation
- Created FUNCTIONAL.md with complete requirements
- Created ARCHITECTURE.md with detailed project architecture
- Created CLAUDE.md with coding standards and guidelines
- Created TO-DO.md with implementation tasks

### Key Decisions

#### Technology Stack
- Language: TypeScript
- Framework: SvelteKit with Svelte 4
- Styling: TailwindCSS with custom components
- Database: SQLite with Prisma ORM
- API: GraphQL with Apollo Client and codegen
- State Management: Svelte stores
- Documentation: Storybook (integrated throughout development)
- Testing: Vitest

#### Architecture
- Layer-based organization (components, stores, utils, server)
- SvelteKit routes for trip management
- GraphQL for data access with Apollo Client
- Prisma schema for database modeling

#### Database Schema
- Separate models for CatalogTrip (predefined) and UserTrip (personalized)
- Many-to-many relationships between activities and locations via junction tables
- Expenses associated directly with CatalogTrip with fixed activity costs
- User identification via local storage

#### Features
Selected 3 core features from the brief:
- Trip Management (browsing trips by continent/country, creating user trips)
- Itinerary Planner (adding activities from locations)
- Expense Tracking (viewing cost breakdown by category)

### Notable Implementation Details
- SQLite + Prisma chosen for simplicity in a workshop context
- Storybook documentation integrated with component development
- Testing set up early in the project
- GraphQL codegen to maintain type safety between schema and code
- Form validation using SvelteKit's form actions

### Deviations from Original Brief
- Simplified auth to just user ID in local storage instead of full authentication
- Activities and expenses handled within trip routes rather than separate routes
- Component structure simplified to shared components + feature components

No changes to the specifications files are needed at this point as they already reflect our decisions.
